# EVE_ONLINE_MarketAnalyzer
This project in total uses 3 web services to get market data using xml and gson data transfer types. Analyzes data taken and makes suggestion to buy spesific item 
and calculates expected profit etc.
In game i was in MJ (pandemic horde) Beanstar so if you want to use this you should change some values inside to make it calculate your market!

To make it work all you have to do is:
  1. going in the executables and run eve online market analyzer
If you want to fetch updated market Items you should first run jita_Item_ID_Getter after that jitaOrderSeeker_VolumeUnder300. These 2 will prepare the environment for eveOnlineMarketAnalyzer.
